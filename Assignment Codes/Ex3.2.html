    <h2>Web Development</h2>
    <p>Web development consists of two main areas: 
        front-end and back-end development. Front-end 
        development focuses on the user interface and 
        experience, using technologies like HTML, CSS, 
        and JavaScript to create interactive and 
        responsive websites. Back-end development, on 
        the other hand, involves server-side programming, 
        databases, and application logic using languages 
        such as Python, PHP, and Node.js. Full-stack 
        developers are skilled in both front-end and 
        back-end technologies, enabling them to build and 
        manage entire web applications. Additionally, 
        frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and 
        Django help streamline the development process.</p>
