    Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites. 
    It encompasses everything from creating simple static pages to complex dynamic applications. 
    <br>Web development typically involves coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for 
    front-end development, which is responsible for the design and user interaction. 
    <br>On the back-end, server-side programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java are 
    used to handle data storage, user authentication, and interactions with databases.</p>

    <ul><p style="color: whitesmoke;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    Web development also includes frameworks and content management systems (CMS) like React, 
    Angular, WordPress, and Django that simplify and speed up the development process. 
    <br>The goal of web development is to create responsive, functional, and 
    user-friendly websites that deliver an 
    excellent experience across various devices and screen sizes. 
    <br>As the digital landscape evolves, web development continues to integrate new 
    technologies and techniques, making it an exciting field that constantly 
    adapts to meet the needs of users and businesses.</p>
