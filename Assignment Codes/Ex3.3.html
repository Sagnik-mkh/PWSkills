    <h2>Web Design</h2>
    <p>Web design is a crucial aspect of web development 
        that focuses on the aesthetics and usability of a website. 
        A well-designed website ensures a seamless user experience 
        by incorporating elements such as color schemes, typography, 
        and navigation. Designers use tools like Adobe XD, Figma, and 
        Sketch to create layouts before developers bring them to life 
        with code. Responsive design is also a key component, ensuring 
        that websites adapt to different screen sizes and devices. 
        A good web design not only enhances the look of a website but 
        also improves user engagement and accessibility.</p>
