    <h2>Introduction to Web Development</h2>
    <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining
        websites and web applications. 
        It involves several disciplines, including front-end 
        development, back-end development, and database management. 
        The front end focuses on the user interface and experience, 
        utilizing technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build 
        interactive and visually appealing web pages. The back end, on 
        the other hand, handles server-side logic, databases, and 
        authentication, ensuring that the website functions smoothly and 
        securely.</p>
