    <p style="width: 800px;">Manchester United Football Club, commonly referred to as Man United
        (often stylised as Man Utd), is a professional football club based in Old Trafford,
        Greater Manchester, England. They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of
        English football. Nicknamed the Red Devils, they were founded as Newton Heath LYR Football
        Club in 1878, but changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. After a spell playing in
        Clayton, Manchester, the club moved to their current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.</p>

    <h2 style="width: 800px;"><strong>Europa League last-16 draw: Man Utd, Tottenham Hotspur and Rangers discover opponents and route to
            final</strong></h2>
    <article style="width: 800px;">Manchester United will face Real Sociedad in the Europa League last 16, while Tottenham play AZ
        Alkmaar and Rangers take on Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce.
        Last-16 ties will begin on March 6 with the second legs on March 13.

        Man Utd and Spurs can only meet in the final but United could play Rangers in the semi-finals or have a reunion
        with their former manager Mourinho.

        Tottenham sacked Mourinho in April 2021, less than a week before they were due to play in the Carabao Cup final,
        and can only face Fenerbache in the final.</article>
